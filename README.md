# www.lwebb.dev

This is my static portfolio site that will also be the home of the lwebb.dev domain for future projects that I may want to use it for (Example: lwebb.dev/project).

This repository uses Node.js to harness the gulp.js cli for the build process. Make sure Node.js is installed as well as gulp-cli installed globally.
Use `npm install` to pull the neccesary gulp plugins into node_modules.
Use `npm run start` to start the gulp sass watcher, and `npm run publish` to build and minify the site from `src` into a `dist` directory.
